I implemented baseline models based on CatBoost and Random Forest algorithms and enhanced their performance using advanced preprocessing and tuning techniques, thereby setting a competitive standard for credit risk prediction. Acknowledging the existing state-of-the-art approaches and their limitations, we propose new methods for credit risk assessment: we focus on developing models that calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) score. The central idea underpinning this research is that these score models are more profitable compared to classical scoring models, offering a new direction for credit risk management in the auto loan segment.
The proposed models were extensively validated on a robust dataset, and a study of the impact of significant feature elimination was conducted to demonstrate the practical implications of the research. A comprehensive comparison with existing approaches was conducted, and the results demonstrate the competitiveness and superior performance of our proposed methodologies.
